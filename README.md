# Microservices

## 🌿 What is the Strangler Pattern?
The Strangler Pattern is a migration strategy where you gradually replace parts of a monolith with microservices — without a full rewrite.

Just like a strangler fig slowly wraps around and replaces a host tree, this pattern encircles the old system with new microservices until the monolith is no longer needed.

## 🧠 Why Use It?

Avoids risky “big bang” rewrites

Lets you modernize incrementally

Reduces downtime and impact on users

Safer rollback and testing
